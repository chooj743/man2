By doing this workshop, it helps participants to think and reflect on each action made; as it practically requires participants to recall the step by step instructions on how to tie a half knot.</p>

	      		<p>Through the observations of the following <i>Knots</i> online workshop<sup>2</sup> conducted by Jodi Choo came the emergence of different behaviour and thoughts from the participants. This study consists of two focus groups, non-designers and designers and will analyse the participants’ reaction during the process. Participants from a design background are able to think more reflectively and critically about their decisions.<br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

					<p>During each encounter with a line, the majority of participants naturally drew their lines directly over another previously drawn line. Thus, this reveals that the participants were unable to illustrate a visual demonstration of a line ‘over and under’. Throughout the whole process, none of the participants questioned the unrealistic dimensions for each line drawn despite some executing the task through their fingers on their smartphones.</p><br><br>

					<p>Similarly, there were no comments regarding the dimensions of the line again. However, this time round participants’ lines were all disconnected from each other due at the start due to a misunderstanding of instructions. One of the participants mistakenly continued his line from another participant’s end. During the process, participants felt lost and unmotivated as to where this task will end up. Yet quickly turned enthusiastic after being able to spot an unintended emerging imagery on the left of the art board.</p><br><br>

		        	<p>Unlike non-designers, designers were instinctively able to illustrate ‘over and under’ effortlessly that this concern was never even brought up during the whole process. Perhaps due to the foundational drawing class that the participants or all designers have undergone. On the other hand, the dimensions were the greatest concern due to the distinctive differences in participants' laptop screen size. Nevertheless, after fully grasping the logic of the framework participants started shifting their perspective into a game rather than doing a task. Participants came up with their own rule in which to block or trap the person after them. While empowering individuals with the ability to destroy lines helps each participant expand their creativity to plan ahead in order to survive and escape from others.</p><br><br>

		        	<p>Before the exercise, it has been decided by the participants that the length of each line should be the length of each own arm. By implementing a system at the start helps to reduce any further distraction during the process. One of the participants mentioned that the type of lines were not specified hence he drew a straight line during his turn. The participant was able to challenge the instructions; in summary hack the system. This resulted in another participant trying to replicate his execution throughout the exercise.</p><br><br>
